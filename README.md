# Minecraft Jar Installer by Gyfen

Hello! This program was made to avoid having to install Java when you've already gotten it bundled with Minecraft.
This program was made using Autohotkey and was designed for Windows 10. This may or may not work on newer or older Windows versions.

Have fun! - Gyfen

## CHANGING THE JAVA EXECUTABLE PATH

The default path for the Java executable bundled with minecraft is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Minecraft Launcher\runtime\java-runtime-alpha\windows-x64\java-runtime-alpha\bin\java.exe".

Your Java executable may be located somewhere else, if you did a custom install. In that case you would need to find and enter the correct path.

Do the following:

1. Browse to the location where you installed this script. By default it is named "MinecraftJarInstaller.exe".

2. Open the program.

3. On the message box, click "Yes".

4. Browse to the folder where you installed Minecraft.

5. Enter the folder named "runtime".

6. Enter the folder named "java-runtime-alpha".

7. Enter the folder named "windows-x64".

8. Enter the folder named "java-runtime-alpha".

9. Enter the folder named "bin".

10. Search for a file named "java.exe" and click on it.

11. Now click on "Save".
